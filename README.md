Real-Time Traffic Detection using YOLOv8 & CUDA
This project demonstrates real-time vehicle and pedestrian detection from a video stream using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and PyTorch with CUDA acceleration. It counts cars, trucks, and people, across frames with unique colors displaying results live and saving detections in a JSON file.
Tech Stack:
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
PyTorch
OpenCV
CUDA (for GPU acceleration)
JSON (for saving detection results)

1. Ensure you have a video file (video.mp4) in the project folder.

2. Run the script: python3 main.py
